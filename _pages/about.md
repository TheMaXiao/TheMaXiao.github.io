I'm a second year PhD candidate supervised by [Assistant Prof. Dong MA](https://www.dongma.info/) at the School of Computing and Information System, [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). I received my bachelor and master degree at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/) supervised by Associate professor [Ronggang Cao](https://smen.bit.edu.cn/szdw/szml/tcykzgcx/qb05/0c0315d65f75461ea333ed903e2e62fe.htm) from 2015-2019 and 2019-2022 respectively. My research interests consist of mobile computing and pervasive sensing, especially the embedded machine learning(TinyML) which enable deep learning models on the resource-constraint embedded devices.
