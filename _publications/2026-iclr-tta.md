This paper introduces a groundbreaking approach to test-time adaptation that operates without requiring backpropagation and works across different neural network architectures.

## Abstract

Test-time adaptation has become crucial for deploying machine learning models in dynamic environments. Our work presents an architecture-agnostic method that achieves effective adaptation through embedding alignment techniques.

## Key Contributions

- Architecture-agnostic adaptation framework
- Backpropagation-free optimization approach  
- Superior performance across diverse model types
- Efficient computational requirements
