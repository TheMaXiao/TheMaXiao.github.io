This paper introduces DiTMoS, a comprehensive framework for selecting and deploying diverse tiny machine learning models on resource-constrained microcontrollers.

## Abstract

The deployment of machine learning models on microcontrollers presents unique challenges due to severe resource constraints. DiTMoS addresses these challenges by providing a systematic approach to model selection and optimization.

## Key Contributions

- Comprehensive model selection framework for TinyML
- Performance evaluation across diverse microcontroller platforms  
- Real-world deployment case studies
- Open-source implementation and benchmarks
